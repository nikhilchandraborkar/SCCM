I have a small favor to ask of you, if you don't mind. Could you spare around 30 seconds for a quick phone survey regarding how you felt about my assistance with your case? These surveys are vital to us and greatly contribute to our improvement. It's a simple survey with just two questions, where you rate your experience from 1 to 5 stars, with 1 indicating poor and 5 indicating excellent. My aim is to consistently provide five-star service for every case. If there are any areas where you feel we could improve, please don't hesitate to share them with me now. Your feedback is invaluable and enables me to address any concerns promptly. 

I'll be giving you a call on the number provided in the case notes. Your participation is much appreciated!

It's my commitment to consistently deliver five-star service on every case. Should there be any aspects that fall short of your expectations, please don't hesitate to share them with me now, allowing me the opportunity to address them promptly. Thank you for your cooperation and feedback in advance.
